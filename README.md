# Tentaizu
A game application written in Java that is based on the Japanese game of Tentaizu.

The Tentaizu project is a game application based on the Japanese game of the same name. The game is played on a 7x7 board with 10 hidden stars, and the player's objective is to determine which squares are hiding the stars.

The application provides clues by displaying numbers in certain squares that indicate how many stars are located in adjacent squares. No square with a number contains a star, but a star may appear in a square with no adjacent numbers.

The project's aim is to provide users with an engaging and challenging gameplay experience by utilizing logic, problem-solving skills, and backtracking to find the hidden stars on the board. The application guarantees a unique solution for each Tentaizu board provided.
